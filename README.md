### Features
---
<!-- <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 125%">Networking</p> -->
##### Networking

The IP Editor tab allows you to quickly change the IP settings of all your network adapters. 
This tab also includes options to add to and search through a database of IP addresses stored as a csv. You can also ping addresses from the database.
In the future, the database feature may be removed and replaced with a simple IP ping/scan option.

<!-- <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 125%">Copy and Paste</p> -->
##### Copy and Paste

The Copy&Paste tab automates data transfer from a file to another file or program.
You can make currently CSVs to easily edit and paste large numbers of cells in PCCU or greatly speed up the entry of gas analysis data into flow meters.
Various file and program types can be easily added in the future. 

<!-- <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 125%">Report Generation</p> -->
##### Report Generation

The File Generator tab can convert/edit data from one document into another.
You can generate company-specific pdf reports from PCCU run reports, create spreadsheet versions of run reports, change data within one or multiple reports, and even package files for how specific companies like them sent. 
Currently, only GC-focused options exist, but any file generation can be easily added.
